                            <p>Blood pressure estimation using smartwatches has become a popular tool for daily blood pressure monitoring. In collaboration with the Korean Hypertension Society, Youngro Lee conducted a statistical analysis of blood pressure measurements in two different years: 2021 with 760 people, and 2022 with 323 people. The main focus of the study was to investigate the role of calibration in blood pressure measurements. Using Linear Mixed Effect Models and Generalized Linear Models, Youngro investigated the impact of days after calibration on blood pressure values and the factors influencing the difference between blood pressure measurements taken after and before calibration. The results of the study were published in prestigious scientific journals, including Hypertension Research and the International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society. In recognition of his outstanding work, Youngro was awarded as the young investigator by the Korean Hypertension Society. With the collaboration of Korean Hypertension Society and Samsung Electronics, the campaign for collecting the dataset and the further research is still ongoing in 2023. </p>

                            <p>Influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) are major epidemic viruses that cause significant economic and social burdens every winter and early spring worldwide. Youngro Lee collaborated with the Pediatric School of Korea University to develop a machine learning prediction model for influenza and RSV using health records, symptoms, and blood test results from 2,654 individuals. In addition to applying published algorithms like XGBoost, MICE imputation, SMOTE, and ensemble techniques, Youngro also proposed a selective prediction model. The prediction model achieved an AUC of 0.906 for influenza and 0.968 for RSV using all available features. When using only symptoms (house available model), the selective prediction model achieved an AUC of 0.864 for 50% of people. RSV showed an AUC of 0.948 with only symptoms. Youngro is currently working with collaborators to submit a paper based on this work. Future plans include developing an app for clinical trials at the hospital of Korea University and performing explainable AI (XAI) analysis. </p>

                            <div class="subheading mb-3">Collaboration: Prof. Barbara Di Camillo, Department of Information Engineering, University of Padova, Italy</div>
                            <p>Microbial data can be a valuable source of biomarkers for various diseases, but identifying them can be challenging due to the large number of phenotypes and limited samples available. Youngro Lee suggested biomarkers of IBD by two different works. 

1)	Machine learning-based feature selection for stable microbial biomarkers (application to inflammatory bowel disease): Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) is a popular algorithm for selecting features to improve performance and discover biomarkers. Youngro suggested mapping features in a closer dimension using the Bray-Curtis similarity matrix before applying RFE. This approach improved stability while maintaining or slightly increasing performance. Youngro is currently working with collaborators to submit a paper to a bioinformatics journal. 

2)	Novel biomarker selection method using SHAP-based binarization: Abundance plots for microbial systems are commonly used for machine learning prediction and biomarker discovery, but small sample sizes can lead to overfitting. Youngro suggested binarizing microbial datasets using SHAP values and proposed an equation for the optimal standard of this binarization. With this algorithm, both performance and stability increased significantly. For example, logistic regression showed an AUC of 0.755 originally, but improved to 0.887 after this transformation. Youngro is currently working with collaborators to submit a paper.</p>

                            <div class="subheading mb-3">Collaboration: Prof. Barbara Di Camillo, Department of Information Engineering, University of Padova, Italy</div>
                            <p>Feature importance is commonly used in medical fields to define risk indicators or biomarkers for diseases. However, the validity of feature importance is not often studied. Youngro Lee suggests investigating the validity of feature importance in low-performing machine learning models and how performance affects its validity. Lee designed the aggravating factors of the machine learning model into two categories: lack of data samples and lack of features. By controlling these two factors independently to decrease the model's performance, the pattern of feature importance values was studied. Lee found that the factor influences the validity of feature importance, not just performance. Lee and collaborators are currently working on submitting a paper on this topic.</p>
